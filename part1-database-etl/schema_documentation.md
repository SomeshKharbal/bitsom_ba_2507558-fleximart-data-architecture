## 2. Normalization Explanation

### a. Third Normal Form (3NF) Justification (≈200–250 words)

The FlexiMart database schema is designed in Third Normal Form (3NF) to ensure data integrity, reduce redundancy, and support efficient updates. Each table represents a single entity type, and all attributes within a table depend solely on the primary key.

In the `customers` table, attributes such as first_name, last_name, email, phone, city, and registration_date depend only on customer_id. No non-key attribute depends on another non-key attribute, ensuring 2NF and 3NF compliance.

The `products` table stores only product-specific attributes. Pricing and stock information are stored once per product, avoiding duplication across orders. This ensures that changes to product price or stock levels require updates in only one place.

The `orders` table separates order-level details from line-item details. Attributes like order_date, total_amount, and status depend only on order_id. Customer information is not duplicated here; instead, a foreign key is used.

The `order_items` table resolves the many-to-many relationship between orders and products. Each non-key attribute (quantity, unit_price, subtotal) depends fully on order_item_id.

### b. Functional Dependencies

- customer_id → first_name, last_name, email, phone, city, registration_date
- product_id → product_name, category, price, stock_quantity
- order_id → customer_id, order_date, total_amount, status
- order_item_id → order_id, product_id, quantity, unit_price, subtotal

### c. Avoidance of Anomalies

- **Update anomaly:** Changes to customer or product information are made in one place only.
- **Insert anomaly:** New customers, products, or orders can be added independently.
- **Delete anomaly:** Deleting an order does not remove customer or product data.
